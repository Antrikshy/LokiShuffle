Loki Shuffle
============

There's not much to this. I was inspired by the title card that appears in promotional material for Marvel Studios' Loki (see end of [this trailer](https://youtu.be/G4JuopziR3Q)). This is a simple webpage that shuffles around the L-O-K-I lettering variants forever.

There is pause/resume control, and you can shuffle the letters individually by clicking on them.

It's not quite perfect, as it's not easy to overlap slanted letters and effects in the letters using four `<img>` elements. If you have ideas (or photo editing skills) to clean it up, pull requests are welcome!
